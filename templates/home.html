<h2>Comparisons</h2>
<p>Comparisons are generated by the bassist. They are diffs between a base
system and an observed system. The diffs from bassist comparisons are gathered
into sets. Click <a href="{{ url_for('comparisons') }}">here</a> to assign
comparison diffs to sets.

<h2>Sets</h2>
<p>Sets are diffs that are gathered together for a purpose. For example: in
configuration management you might specify "install package apache", which
installs several packages, installs a new user or group, installs a service,
and starts a system process. Click <a href="{{ url_for('sets') }}">here</a> to
view and edit the diffs within sets.
