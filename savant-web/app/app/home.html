<h3>Comparisons</h3>
<p>Comparisons are generated by the bassist. They are diffs between a base
    system and an observed system. The diffs from bassist comparisons are gathered
    into sets. Click <a href="" ui-sref="dashboard.comparisons">here</a> to assign
    comparison diffs to sets.

<h3>Sets</h3>
<p>Sets are diffs that are gathered together for a purpose. For example: in
    configuration management you might specify "install package apache", which
    installs several packages, installs a new user or group, installs a service,
    and starts a system process. Click <a href="" ui-sref="dashboard.sets">here</a> to
    view and edit the diffs within sets.
